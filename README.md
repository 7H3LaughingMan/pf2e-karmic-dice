This module adds Karmic Dice to all check rolls in Pathfinder 2nd Edition.

## Settings

**Roles**

Allows you to set which rolls Karmic Dice is enabled for.

**History**

PF2e Karmic Dice keeps track of the last **X** number of rolls for each individual user. This allows you to set what **X** is. Until a user's history length matches **X** it will not attempt to check to see if a user's roll needs to be nudged.

**Lower Threshold**

When enabled this sets the lower threshold that the average value of a user's historical rolls need to be less than or equal to before it will nudge that user's roll upwards.

**Upper Threshold**

When enabled this sets the upper threshold that the average value of a user's historical rolls need to be greater than or equal to before it will nudge that user's roll downwards.

**Nudge**

This sets the amount that a user's roll will be nudged by. If you enable the **Cumulative** option it will multiply the nudge value by the number of times it has had to nudge a user's dice in a row.

**Hero Points**

When enabled this will nudge any rerolls using a Hero Point upwards by **value** if the natural result of the reroll is less than or equal to the **threshold**.
